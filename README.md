The `data-ocd-psyctr` dataset is a meta-analytic research domain [MARD](https://docs.metapsy.org/uploads/ebmental-2022-300509.pdf)) on psychotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This MARD is part of the  [Metapsy project](https://www.metapsy.org/). The dataset contains study information and effect size data of trials that report the effect of psychotherapy on OCD symptoms. This dataset includes **psychotherapy vs. control ('psy vs ctr')** comparisons. Effect sizes are provided for outcomes at post-test. The results of a meta-analysis using this database can be read in this  [published article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2810866).

The dataset follows the [Metapsy data standard](https://docs.metapsy.org/data-preparation/format/). All included information has been independently extracted two researchers. Risk of bias ratings were conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool (Version 2).
